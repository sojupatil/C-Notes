# C Programming Syllabus
*Preparation Steps*

Gather Resources: Use a beginner-friendly C programming book (e.g., "Let Us C" by Yashavant Kanetkar), an IDE (e.g., Turbo C++ or Code::Blocks), and online tutorials for reference.

Daily Study Time: Dedicate at least 2–3 hours daily for study and practice. Focus more on coding hands-on.

Practice-Oriented Approach: Understand concepts, implement code, and solve problems to reinforce learning.

## UNIT I: Problem Solving, Algorithms, and Flowcharts (06 Hours)

Day 1–2

Concepts to Cover:

Types of problems and problem-solving techniques.

Definition and characteristics of algorithms.

Flowchart creation and top-down design approach.

Problem-solving using arithmetic, conditional, and iterative statements.

Tasks:

Practice writing algorithms and drawing flowcharts for simple problems:

Arithmetic: Addition, multiplication.

Conditional: Find maximum of 2 or 3 numbers, check if a number is positive or negative.

Iterative: Sum of first n numbers, reverse digits of a number, check palindrome.

Implement basic problems in C: Factorial, GCD, LCM, prime check, etc.

## UNIT II: C Fundamentals (07 Hours)

Day 3–6

Concepts to Cover:

Structure of a C program, character set, identifiers, and keywords.

Data types, type casting, and variable declarations.

Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, ternary, etc.

Input/output functions: printf, scanf, getchar, putchar, gets, puts.

Tasks:

Write simple programs to explore each operator and data type.

Use printf and scanf for formatted I/O; explore escape sequences like \n, \t.

Create and run small programs using all operators.

Practice string input/output using gets and puts.

## UNIT III: Control and Iterative Structures (05 Hours)

Day 7–9

Concepts to Cover:

Conditional statements: if, if-else, nested if, switch.

Loops: while, do-while, for.

Jump statements: break, continue, goto.

Tasks:

Write programs using if-else and switch to solve real-life problems (e.g., grade calculation, menu-driven programs).

Implement loops for tasks like printing patterns, calculating sums/products, factorial, Fibonacci series, etc.

Use break and continue in loop scenarios (e.g., skipping specific iterations).

Avoid goto initially but understand its working through examples.

## UNIT IV: Functions (06 Hours)

Day 10–12

Concepts to Cover:

Types of functions: Library functions (e.g., sqrt, pow) and user-defined functions.

Function arguments: Call by value and call by reference.

Recursion: Factorial, Fibonacci series, GCD.

Storage classes: auto, static, global, and register.

Tasks:

Write programs using user-defined functions for modular coding.

Solve problems using recursive functions.

Test storage classes with examples to see their effect on variables.

## UNIT V: Arrays (06 Hours)

Day 13–15

Concepts to Cover:

Single-dimensional arrays: Storing and manipulating data (e.g., sum, maximum, sorting).

Two-dimensional arrays: Matrix representation, addition, and multiplication.

Arrays and functions: Passing arrays to functions.

Tasks:

Write programs to input and manipulate arrays (e.g., finding the maximum/minimum).

Solve matrix problems (e.g., addition, transpose, multiplication).

Use arrays to solve problems like searching, sorting, and reversing.

Review and Practice (2–3 Days)

Tasks:

Revise key concepts from all units.

Implement 5–10 programs from each unit to consolidate learning.

Solve past exam questions.

Debug and analyze errors in your programs to build problem-solving skills.

Tips for Success

Practice Daily: Coding is best learned through consistent practice.

Work on Small Projects: Combine multiple concepts (e.g., arrays + loops) to solve complex problems.

Seek Feedback: Share code with peers or instructors to improve.
