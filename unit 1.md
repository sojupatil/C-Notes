# C Notes 

## About C 
C is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. It is widely known for its efficiency and control over system resources, making it suitable for system programming, embedded systems, and applications requiring high performance.

C provides features like low-level memory manipulation, a rich set of operators, and straightforward syntax, which has influenced many modern programming languages like C++, Java, and Python. It allows direct access to hardware, making it ideal for writing operating systems, compilers, and other system software. C also supports structured programming, using functions and blocks of code to improve readability and maintainability.

## Variables in C 

In C, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated in a program. Each variable has a name, a type, and a value.

Name: The label you give the variable (e.g., age, score).

Type: Specifies what kind of data the variable will hold (e.g., int for integers, float for decimal numbers).

Value: The actual data stored in the variable (e.g., 5, 3.14).


Example:

``` int age = 20; ```  'int' is the type, 'age' is the name, and 20 is the value

In this example, age is a variable that stores an integer (20).



```
#include <stdio h>
#include <conio.h>
void main(){
printf("Hello World");
getch();
 }
```
